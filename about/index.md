title: About me
---

I'm fascinated by languages, both human and machine, and the connections between the two. I recently completed a MS in computational linguistics at [Saarland University](http://coli.uni-saarland.de) in Germany, where I studied speech technology, machine learning, and computer-assisted language learning. Prior to that, I earned a BA in philosophy from UC Berkeley, studying formal logic and the philosophy of mind and language. I later worked in sales for a SaaS company in San Francisco, and taught English as a foreign language in SF and Vietnam. Meanwhile, I taught myself Python on the side, which ultimately led me to computational linguistics.

In grad school I fell in love with software development, so I spent the fall of 2015 at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com), honing my coding skills by working on: improving my JavaScript fluency, writing functional code, contributing to open-source projects like [Zulip](http://www.zulip.org), exploring CPython internals, visualizing data with libraries like [D3](http://d3js.org/), and making test-driven development a habit.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, swing dancing, knitting, karaoke, and listening to live music. You can usually find me in the sunniest spot in the room (or the spot closest to a dog).
