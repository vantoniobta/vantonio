title: About me
---

I'm fascinated by languages, both human and machine, and the connections between the two. I recently completed a MS in computational linguistics at [tec_tamazunchale](http://tectamazunchale.edu.mx/itstmz/) in MÃ©xico, where I studied speech technology, machine learning, and computer-assisted language learning. Prior to that, I earned a BA in philosophy from UC Berkeley, studying formal logic and the philosophy of mind and language. Meanwhile, I taught myself Python on the side, which ultimately led me to computational linguistics.

When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy traveling, learning foreign languages, swing dancing, knitting, karaoke, and listening to live music. You can usually find me in the sunniest spot in the room (or the spot closest to a dog).
